# nachos
nachos lab of OS Design in SDU (C/C++ version)

Now:

	Lab5 Finished	

	Lab6-7 Finished

	Lab8 Finished

Intro:

	During Lab8, I misunderstood the function of Exce() to Join(), thus some code of Join are finished already (such as Save/Load memory when switch context).

	If you have any problems, I'll be grateful if you can raise an issue or just push to this project.

	Sorry for any bug or mistake in this project.

Use:

	Clone this project to your homedir and run 'make' './nachos ......' or any shell script in the lab subdir.

	For example, in lab5, you can see results of 'Append' and 'NAppend' after running ap.sh or nap.sh .
