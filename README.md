# nachos(C/C++ version)
nachos lab of OS Design in SDU 2016

## Now:

* Lab3-5 Finished	
* Lab6-7 Finished
* Lab8 Finished

## Intro:

* In Lab8, I misunderstood the function of Exce() to Join(). Thus some code of Join() is finished already (such as Save/Load memory in context switch).

* If you have any problems, feel free to raise an issue or just push it to this project.

* Sorry for any bugs or mistakes in this project.

## Use:

* Clone this project to your homedir and run 'make' './nachos ......' or any shell scripts in the lab subdir.
* For example, in lab5, you can see results of function 'Append' or 'NAppend' after running ap.sh or nap.sh .
