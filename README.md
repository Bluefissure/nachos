# nachos(C/C++ version)
nachos lab of OS Design in SDU 2016

##Now:

* Lab5 Finished	
* Lab6-7 Finished
* Lab8 Finished

##Intro:

* During Lab8, I misunderstood the function of Exce() to Join(). Thus some code of Join() are finished already (such as Save/Load memory when switching context).

* If you have any problems, I'll be grateful if you can raise an issue or just push to this project.

* Sorry for any bugs or mistakes in this project.

##Use:

* Clone this project to your homedir and run 'make' './nachos ......' or any shell script in the lab subdir.
* For example, in lab5, you can see results of function 'Append' or 'NAppend' after running ap.sh or nap.sh .
